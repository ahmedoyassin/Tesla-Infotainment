**Welcome to the Tesla Infotainment System project, developed using Qt and QML. This advanced infotainment system provides an intuitive and engaging user experience, incorporating several key features:**
**1- Interactive Map:** Explore your surroundings with ease using our interactive map. You can zoom in and out, and drag to navigate through different locations. (Please note that the map's location reading functionality is currently in development.)

**2- AC Controls:** Effortlessly manage the climate in your vehicle with dedicated AC buttons for both the driver and passengers. Control the air conditioning settings for a comfortable journey.

**3- Real-Time Information:** Stay informed with real-time updates on various aspects of your vehicle:

**Current Time:** Always know the time with a clear and precise display.
**Logged User:** See the current user logged into the infotainment system.
**Car State:** Easily check whether the car is currently on or off.
**Temperature:** View the current temperature inside and outside the vehicle.
**Please Note:** This project is currently incomplete and will be updated periodically with new features and improvements.
